# FINAL_PROJECT

This was made as part of a programming bootcamp I attended - the final and defining part, hence the title.

The entire project comprises two parts: one is a simple Symfony database of a small translations agency: contains client information, translators data, proofreaders data, language pair and fields. Allows to add entries, and modify them.
(TO DO: Add projects table, storing translator, proofreader, and client ids, paths to file, translated file and proofread file).

The other, the more flashy one, is a form that enables a user to prepare a quote of a docx file with a text that one wants to have translated: the form uploads the file, counts the number of characters (with spaces) in it, takes account of the language pair (ie. the source language and the language of the translation) and the field (eg. law, or medicine), and on this basis modifies the ppp (price per page), all in one go, without refreshing the site.

(TO DO: translate fields into English)
